External Electric [[Field]] increases the blocking force of electron flow through diffusion. Depletion Region is then enlarged and there is only little current flow.

The leaking current is known as the reverse saturation current due to "generation". ($I_{ ss }$)

External Electric [[Field]] weakened the built-in Electric [[Field]]. The diffusion is again activated and thus the current flows from $P$ to $N$.

## General Case

![[Pasted image 20220424153051.png|500]]

$$i_D = 
I_{ ss }( e^{ \frac{ v_D }{ v_T } } - 1 )$$

$$v_T = \frac{ KT }{ q } \quad 
\text{ (thermal voltage, 26mV@room temp) }$$

when $v_D >> v_T$

$$i_D = I_{ ss } e^{ \frac{ v_D }{ v_T } }$$
