# Exact first-order equation

standard differential form: 
$$M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy = 0$$
standard dirivative form: 
$$y' = f(x,y) \implies f(x,y)dx + (-1)dy = 0$$
recall the total differential: 
$$df = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}dx + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}dy \implies \int df = f(x,y) = k$$

# Exact differential equation

$M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy = 0$ is an exact differential equation. $\iff$ There exists a function $f(x,y)$ such that $M = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ , $N = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$

solution of an exact differential equation:
$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}dx + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}dy = 0$
$\implies df(x,y) = 0 \implies f(x,y)=k$

當碰到standard differential form，可以直接用積分，得出 $f(x,y) = k$

# 如何判斷是否為 Exact differential equation

If $\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}$ and $\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}$ are continuous in a rectangular region $R$ , then the D.E. $M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy = 0$ is exact $\iff \frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial N}{\partial x}$ in $R$
