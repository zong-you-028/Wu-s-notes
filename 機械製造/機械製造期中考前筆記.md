## Measurement and Inspection

### Accuracy and Precise

![[Accuracy and Precise.png]]

### The Rule of Ten

測量的方法必須比所要達到的精度準至少十倍

### Visual Inspection

直接用看的

### Liquid Penetrant Inspection

包含四個步驟

1. 工件有裂痕
2. 將 penetrant 塗上去
	- penetrant 通常是一種顏料，有時也會用有放射性物質或紫外線照射會顯現等顏料以方便辨識
3. 等待 penetrant 滲入裂縫中，並清洗或抹除表面的顏料
4. 塗上 developer
	- developer 是一種具有吸收性的材質，可以把顏料吸到表面以方便辨識

### Magnetic Particle Inspection

- nondestructive testing
- used to detect surface and subsurface (surface near but not exposed) discontinuities
- used in ferromagnetic materials (iron, nickel, cobalt...)
- use magnetic field to magnetize material

The presence of discontinuity allows magnetic flux to leak

![[magnetic particle inspection.png]]

#### Direct Magnetization

Electric current is passed through the test object and form a magnetic field

#### Indirect Magnetization

No electric current is passed through. Magnetic field is applied from an outside source.

### Ultrasonic Inspection

Uses very short ultrasonic waves (0.1 ~ 15MHz, occasionally up to 50 MHz) to detect internal flaws in materials

Usually on steel and other metals, but can be used on concrete, wood, and composites with less resolution.

![[ultrasonic testing example.png]]

- left:
	- first pulse: initial pulse of probe
	- second pulse: the back wall echo
- right: the crack simultaneously reduce the amplitude of the back wall echo

The depth of the crack can be determined by the ratio $D / E_p$

### Radiography

用 X 光照射

### Eddy-Current Testing

使用不斷改變的磁場，會使工件產生感應電流，並且產生不同的 [[Impedance]]、電流與電壓，因此可以看出表面瑕疵

![[eddy-current testing.png]]

### Acoustic Emission Monitoring

在製造過程中，如果產生 [[Deformation]] 或破裂，工件會發出聲音。這些聲音介於 $20 \sim 1200kHz$ 之間，可以收音並分析是否有斷裂的聲音。

## Solidification

There will be some defects in solidification

1. gas porosity
2. shrinkage

> ### Gas Porosity
> 
> the formation of bubbles within the casting after it has cooled.

Solidification contains two stages

1. nucleation
2. growth

### Shrinkage

![[solidification shrinkage.png]]

### Nucleation

當液體變成固體時發生，會形成液體與固體之間的膜。這個過程需要能量，因此實際形成溫度低於熔點

> #### Undercooling
> 
> 熔點與實際形成溫度的差

- 在倒進模子前液體中會有結塊固體，這會幫助 grain 形成

### Growth

熱從液體散失時會收縮，收縮速度會與晶體形成有關，因此我們會希望可以控制熱散失的速度

如果散失速度快，晶體形成較小

### Cooling Curves

![[Casting Process#Cooling Curves]]

當材料是混合物的時候，圖會長這樣

![[phase diagram of alloy with a freezing range.jpg]]

### Chvorinov's Rule

用來推估 Solidification 需要的時間

放出熱量的兩個因素為放熱的表面積與放熱的周遭環境

$$t_s = B(\frac{ V }{ A })^n \qquad \text{ where } n = 1.5 \text{ to } 2.0$$

$t_s$: the time from pouring to solidification
$B$: the mold constant
$V$: the volume of the casting
$A$: the surface area through which heat is rejected

### Cast Structure

包含三個區域

1. Chill Zone
	- 在模子的壁上比較冰，因此會產生一層薄的結晶
2. Columnar Zone
	- 細長、垂直於模子的璧
3. Equiaxed Zone
	- 圓形、隨機分佈的結晶，在內部

工件被磁化後會產生磁力線，而在斷裂周圍磁力線會彎曲且通過表面，因此磁力的粉末會被通過表面的磁力線吸引，讓我們看到斷裂的地方
