# Measurement and Inspection

## Accuracy and Precise

![[Accuracy and Precise.png]]

## The Rule of Ten

測量的儀器必須比製造的工件準 10 倍

## Magnetic Particle Inspection

- nondestructive testing
- used to detect surface and subsurface (surface near but not exposed) discontinuities
- used in ferromagnetic materials (iron, nickel, cobalt...)
- use magnetic field to magnetize material

The presence of discontinuity allows magnetic flux to leak

### Direct Magnetization

Electric current is passed through the test object and form a magnetic field

### Indirect Magnetization

No electric current is passed through. Magnetic field is applied from an outside source.

## Ultrasonic Inspection

Uses very short ultrasonic waves (0.1 ~ 15MHz, occasionally up to 50 MHz) to detect internal flaws in materials

Usually on steel and other metals, but can be used on concrete, wood, and composites with less resolution.

- left:
	- first pulse: initial pulse of probe
	- second pulse: the back wall echo
- right: the crack simultaneously reduce the amplitude of the back wall echo

The depth of the crack can be determined by the ratio $D / E_p$

# Solidification

There will be some defects in solidification

1. gas porosity
2. solidification

Solidification contains two stages

1. nucleation
2. growth

## Nucleation

- 當液體變成固體時發生
- 形成液體與固體之間的膜，需要能量
- 因為需要能量，因此實際的形成溫度低於熔點
	- 熔點與實際溫度的差稱為 "the amount of [[Undercooling]]"
	- 如果已經有固體存在（譬如模子的壁），耗能會變小，因此 [[Undercooling]] 會變小
- 在倒進模子前液體中會有結塊固體，這會幫助結晶形成，稱為 [[Inoculation]] 或 [[Grain Refinement]]

## Growth

熱從液體散失時會收縮，其他液體會補位

## Cooling Curves

[[Casting Process#Cooling Curves]]

當材料是混合物的時候，圖會長這樣
